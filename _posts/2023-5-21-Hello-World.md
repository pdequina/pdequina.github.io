# LeetGrind Begins!

Hello, World! Here's the big news - I just crossed the 50-problem threshold on my LeetCode journey. Yeah, that's right! A half-century of coding problems under my belt, and I'm pumped to share some of my experiences, tips, and a few cheeky insights from along the way.

## Conquering LeetCode: The First 50 Steps

So here's the score: 50 problems tackled on LeetCode - 45 marked as Easy (they still made me sweat a bit, trust me) and 5 Medium ones that really cranked up the heat. And, oh boy, what an incredible ride it's been so far!

Each problem is like a riddle, waiting to be solved. And when that "Accepted" message finally pops up, it's a real fist-pump moment.

Wanna see it in action? Here's a clip of yours truly taking down a Medium-level problem and the sweet moment of victory when it was accepted!

## Notion: The Quest Companion

Now, how do I keep track of this wild ride? Say hello to Notion, my trusted sidekick in this epic quest. Take a sneak peek at my Notion workspace, I've crafted a neat table for tracking my stats and progress.

And it doesn't stop there. With page view, I can dive deeper into each problem for further review. It's like having a quest log of my problem-solving adventures.

I gotta say, the timeline view in Notion is a real game-changer. Here's a snapshot of all 50 problems I've conquered so far!

## GitHub: The Vault of Code Wisdom

Here's a sneak peek into one of the files from my treasure chest. Just a typical example of a problem I've nailed.

## Onwards and Upwards!

Cracking the first 50 problems has been a blast. It's pushed me, challenged me, and most importantly, taught me a ton. I can't wait to see what the next 50 problems have in store!

If you're just starting on your coding adventure or you're a seasoned pro, I'd love to hear from you. Let's share the highs, the lows, and all the code in between.

Stay tuned for more updates from my coding odyssey!
